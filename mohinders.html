					<h6>Objective</span></h6>
					<p>As a new company, mohinders wants to build out the consumer side of their business, and wants your business analysis, design and marketing recommendations. They would specifically like to focus on expanding their current knowledge of their target markets and what drives them to purchase mohinders, as well as gaining a better understanding of key competitors' consumer marketing strategies. These findings should then be incorporated into the redesign of mohinders' website.</p>

					<h6>Design Solution</span></h6>
					<p>A website that tells the mohinders story throughout the buying process, and emphasizes transparency and authenticity without coming across as a charity.</p>

					<h6><span>Stakeholder Interview</span></h6>
					<p>We met with our client, Michael, to define the scope of our engagement with mohinders. To simplify the decisionmaking process, we asked our client to rank several priorities in order of importance. The following key objectives were established:
					<ol><li>Develop a deeper understanding of target customers</li>
					<li>Redesign the mohinders website based on findings</li>
					<li>Strengthen brand identity on mohinders.com </li></ol></p>
					<br><h6><span>Customer Research Surveys</span></h6>
					<p>In order to better understand mohinders' target customers and their sentiments towards the brand and its competitors, we created two surveys. One asked early adopters of the product why they purchased mohinders, and the other asked potential customers in mohinders' target demographic for their thoughts on mohinders competitors.</p>

				<div class="eight columns">
					<h6><span>Survey 1: Early Adopters</span></h6>
					<p>This survey was designed to answer the following questions: </p>
					<ul>
					<li>• Who are existing customers, and how did they find out about mohinders?</li>
					<li>• Where do they wear their mohinders shoes? </li>
					<li>• What words would they use to describe mohinders?</li>
					</ul><br>
					<p>
					The survey was instrumental in understanding the various customer personas. There was a wide age distribution (35% were age 18-29 and 38% were age 30-49) evenly divided between male and female, but there were sharp differences between how these demographics used the shoes. While both genders wore mohinders most commonly “around the house” or while “running errands”, males wore mohinders “to the beach” 64% more than females, whereas females wore them “to the office” 79% more than males.

				<div class="eight columns">
					<img  src="images/results.png" alt="" />	
					<p>
					Customers first heard about mohinders primarily through Kickstarter, word-of-mouth, or social media. A majority of customers were California residents in creative or technical professions. These insights helped us to create realistic user personas and associated user stories. 
					</p>
					<p>
					We created a word cloud based on the words used to describe mohinders, which provided important insights on customers' sentiments towards mohinders. The responses confirmed that our client's existing brand focus aligned with common customer sentiments: mohinders shoes are "unique", "stylish", and "high quality". However, the responses also highlighted another common theme: customers were interested in the backstory to mohinders, as illustrated by words like "ethical", "India", "handmade", ethnic", and even "Michael".

			<div class="container">
				<div class="eight columns">
					<h6><span>Survey 2:Potential Customers</span></h6>
					<p>We surveyed non-customers in the target demographic to understand perceptions of mohinders and its competitors: </p>	
					<ul>
					<li>• What are potential customers' sentiments towards mohinders' competitors?</li>
					<li>• What level of brand recognition does mohinders have within the target demographic?</li>
					</ul> <br>
					<p>mohinders was relatively unknown within the survey group, but the questionnaire yielded valuable insights into how potential customers viewed competitors. mohinders' main competitor, TOMS, was described with words such as “charity”, “one-for-one”, “philanthropy”, and “hipster”. Clearly, social good and a hip, trendy style went hand-in-hand to define the TOMS brand. Understanding how competitors were perceived helped us to carve out a distinctive brand for mohinders and emphasize the most unique and important elements with our site redesign. </p>

				<div class="eight columns">
					<h6><span>Sketching and Wireframes</span></h6>
					<p>The objective of our redesign was to emphasize a narrative structure based on users’ strong interest in the company’s backstory. We wanted to build a visual website to engage users with pictures from India using modern design standards. We also aimed to make the company seem more personable. </p>

					<p>After sketching our initial ideas, we combined the best qualities of our sketches into 2 versions of a new homepage, 1 product page, and 3 versions of the “Our Story” page. We then created high fidelity wireframes, complete with images, in order to test whether our visual narrative structures were effective. </p>

				<div class="eight columns">

					<h6><span>User Testing</span></h6>
					<p>We performed A/B tests on the design variations to gather feedback and performance data from various users, including Michael (our client). Usability and layout were more important than specific visual feedback, so we set our placeholder images to 50% opacity before printing out the wireframes. We started by gathering subjective feedback, and then asked users to perform basic navigation tasks to objectively evaluate the usability of each variation. </p>

					<p>User feedback and suggestions:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>• Timeline design was easy to understand, but the “backstory” and “business” sections weren’t clearly differentiated.</li>
					<li>• Copy in the navigation bar was too India-centric. Michael suggested changing “handmade in India” to “handwoven leather.”</li>
					<li>• Content-heavy homepage would benefit from the addition of shortcut links within the page.</li>
					<li>• Since there was a newsletter signup section but mohinders doesn’t yet have a regular newsletter, this section should be converted to a “featured press” section.</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="sixteen columns">
				<h6>Visual Mockup and Prototype</h6><br>
				<p>We incorporated the feedback into our designs, and then dove into the mockups. It was important to create high fidelity mockups because the visuals are so important to the site’s narrative design. We put the mockups on Invision to show michael how customers would interact with mohinders’ new site. [ <a href="http://invis.io/UJ16J22N9" target="_blank">View the Invision Prototype Here</a> ]</p><br>

				<p>When delivering the mockups to our client, the inclusion of annotations was crucial. Our client expressed that having some guidelines for what to put in each section of the site, what images to use, and how to implement certain design features would be valuable moving forward. </p><br>

				<p>We also created a simplified style guide to pass along with the annotated mockups, to provide guidance for mohinders when they implement our designs.</p><br>
